            Users are not entitled to claim any refund, except where believed
            and confirmed that Sentrei has charged the user in error. As Sentrei

          <ul>
            <li>
              (i) that you are trying to unfairly exploit this refund policy,
              for example, by making repetitive refund requests in respect of

            </li>
            <li>(ii) that you are in breach of the terms of this License;</li>
            <li>
              (iii) that you are using any of our products fraudulently or that

            </li>
            <li>
              (iv) that you purchased Sentrei Premium Subscription or Sentrei
              Earnings Packages through a third party service and the terms of
              such third party do not allow such refund. This refund policy does
              not affect any of your statutory rights to pursue a claim.

          <h2>42. Binding Arbitration of All Disputes; No Class Relief</h2>
          <p>
            Please read the following section carefully because it requires you
            to arbitrate certain disputes and claims with Sentrei, Inc. and
            limits the manner in which you can seek relief from us, unless you
            opt out of arbitration by following the instructions set forth
            below. No class or representative actions or arbitrations are
            allowed under this arbitration agreement. In addition, arbitration
            precludes you from suing in court or having a jury trial.
          </p>
          <h3>No Representative Actions</h3>
          <p>
            You and Sentrei, Inc. agree that any dispute arising out of or
            related to these Terms or our Services is personal to you and
            Sentrei, Inc. and that any dispute will be resolved solely through
            individual action, and will not be brought as a class arbitration,
            class action or any other type of representative proceeding.
          </p>
          <h3>Arbitration of Disputes</h3>
          <p>
            Except for small claims disputes in which you or Sentrei, Inc. seeks
            to bring an individual action in small claims court located in the
            county of your billing address or disputes in which you or Sentrei,
            Inc. seeks injunctive or other equitable relief for the alleged
            unlawful use of intellectual property, you and Sentrei, Inc. waive
            your rights to a jury trial and to have any dispute arising out of
            or related to these Terms or our Services resolved in court.
            Instead, for any dispute or claim that you have against Sentrei,
            Inc. or relating in any way to the Services, you agree to first
            contact Sentrei, Inc. and attempt to resolve the claim informally by
            sending a written notice of your claim (“Notice”) to Sentrei, Inc.
            by email at Info@Sentrei.co The Notice must
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              1. Include your name, residence address, email address, and
              telephone number;
            </li>
            <li>2. Describe the nature and basis of the claim; and </li>
            <li>3. Set forth the specific relief sought. </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Our notice to you will be similar in form to that described above.
            If you and Sentrei, Inc. cannot reach an agreement to resolve the
            claim within thirty (30) days after such Notice is received, then
            either party may submit the dispute to binding arbitration
            administered by JAMS or, under the limited circumstances set forth
            above, in court. All disputes submitted to JAMS will be resolved
            through confidential, binding arbitration before one arbitrator. In
            accordance with the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules and
            Procedures (“JAMS Rules”). The most recent version of the JAMS Rules
            is available on the JAMS blog site and are hereby incorporated by
            reference. You either acknowledge or agree that you have read and
            understand the JAMS Rules or waive your opportunity to read the JAMS
            Rules and waive any claim that the JAMS Rules are unfair or should
            not apply for any reason.
          </p>
          <p>
            You and Sentrei, Inc. agree that these Terms affect interstate
            commerce and that the enforceability of this Section will be
            substantively and procedurally governed by the Federal Arbitration
            Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1, et seq. (the “FAA”), to the maximum extent
            permitted by applicable law. As limited by the FAA, these Terms and
            the JAMS Rules, the arbitrator will have exclusive authority to make
            all procedural and substantive decisions regarding any dispute and
            to grant any remedy that would otherwise be available in court,
            including the power to determine the question of arbitrability. The
            arbitrator may conduct only an individual arbitration and may not
            consolidate more than one individual’s claims, preside over any type
            of class or representative proceeding or preside over any proceeding
            involving more than one individual.
          </p>
          <p>
            The arbitrator, Sentrei, Inc., and you will maintain the
            confidentiality of any arbitration proceedings, judgments and
            awards, including, but not limited to, all information gathered,
            prepared and presented for purposes of the arbitration or related to
            the dispute(s) therein. The arbitrator will have the authority to
            make appropriate rulings to safeguard confidentiality, unless the
            law provides to the contrary. The duty of confidentiality does not
            apply to the extent that disclosure is necessary to prepare for or
            conduct the arbitration hearing on the merits, in connection with a
            court application for a preliminary remedy or in connection with a
            judicial challenge to an arbitration award or its enforcement, or to
            the extent that disclosure is otherwise required by law or judicial
            decision.

            <strong>
              Any claim arising out of or related to these Terms or our Services
              must be filed within one year after such claim arose; otherwise,
              the claim is permanently barred, which means that you and Sentrei,
              Inc. will not have the right to assert the claim.
            </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>
              You have the right to opt out of binding arbitration within 30
              days of the date you first accepted the terms of this agreement by
              sending an email to Info@Sentrei.co.
            </strong>
            In order to be effective, the opt-out notice must include your full
            name and address and clearly indicate your intent to opt out of
            binding arbitration. By opting out of binding arbitration, you are
            agreeing to resolve disputes in accordance with this agreement.
          </p>
          <p>
            If any portion of this Section is found to be unenforceable or
            unlawful for any reason, (a) the unenforceable or unlawful provision
            shall be severed from these Terms; (b) severance of the
            unenforceable or unlawful provision shall have no impact whatsoever
            on the remainder of this terms or the parties’ ability to compel
            arbitration of any remaining claims on an individual basis pursuant
            to this terms; and (c) to the extent that any claims must therefore
            proceed on a class, collective, consolidated, or representative
            basis, such claims must be litigated in a civil court of competent
            jurisdiction and not in arbitration, and the parties agree that
            litigation of those claims shall be stayed pending the outcome of
            any individual claims in arbitration. Further, if any part of this
            terms is found to prohibit an individual claim seeking public
            injunctive relief, that provision will have no effect to the extent
            such relief is allowed to be sought out of arbitration, and the
            remainder of this terms will be enforceable.
