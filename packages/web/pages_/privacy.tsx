            identifying information is not used in a way that identifies,
            distinguishes or traces you or your Device, but is instead used in
            an anonymous way, often aggregated with other anonymous Data about

          </p>
          <h2>5. Personal Information We Collect About You (PIPEDA)</h2>
          <p>

            documents act, 2000 (PIPEDA), “personal information” means

            to relate it back to you through your name, address, e-mail address,
            telephone number and any other information that can identify you. If
            information cannot be related to an identifiable individual it is
            considered anonymous information (such as laboratory results
            identified by alpha-numeric identifier instead of individual’s
            name). Whenever possible, Sentrei works with anonymous information.
            This privacy statement does not apply to anonymous information.

          <h2>7. Non-Personal Information</h2>
          <p>
            Non-personal information refers to information that, by itself, does
            not identify you as a specific individual (e.g. demographic
            information or web site visitations). Sentrei may collect
            non-personal information through any of the methods discussed above
            as well as automatically through use of industry standard
            technologies described further below.
          </p>
          <h2>8. Information Collected Through Technology</h2>
          <p>
            While you are able to visit the Sentrei site and remain anonymous,
            Sentrei or its third party service providers may still collect
            non-personal information about your use of the Sentrei materials
            (e.g. Your internet browser, operating system, ip address,
            connection speed, and the domain name of your internet service
            provider). Such information may be gathered by the following
            methods:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              (a)<strong>Cookies. Cookies,</strong> including local shared
              objects, are small pieces of information that are stored by your
              browser on your device’s hard drive which work by assigning to
              your computer a unique number that has no meaning outside of the
              Sentrei site. Cookies do not generally contain any personal
              information. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but
              you can usually configure your browser to prevent this. Not
              accepting cookies may make certain features of the Sentrei
              materials unavailable to you.
            </li>
            <li>
              (b)<strong>IP address.</strong> You may visit many areas of the
              Sentrei site anonymously without the need to become a registered
              user. Even in such cases, Sentrei may collect ip addresses
              automatically. An IP address is a number that is automatically
              assigned to your computer whenever you begin services with an
              internet services provider. Each time you access the Sentrei site
              and each time you request one of Sentrei’ pages, the server logs
              your ip address.
            </li>
            <li>
              (c)<strong>Beacons.</strong> Beacons are small pieces of data that
              are embedded in web pages and e-mails. Sentrei may use these
              technical methods in html e-mails that Sentrei sends to users to
              determine whether they have opened those e-mails and/or clicked on
              links in those e-mails. The information from use of these
              technical methods may be collected in a form that&nbsp;constitutes
              personal information.
            </li>
            <li>
              (d)<strong>Tracking content usage.</strong> If you use the Sentrei
              services and you post audio visual materials including, without
              limitation, text, logos, artwork, graphics, pictures,
              advertisements, sound and other related intellectual property
              contained in such materials (collectively, “content”) to your app
              site or to a third party app site, Sentrei tracks and captures
              non-personal information associated with user accounts and the use
              of content.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h2>9. Other Information You May Submit</h2>

            customer support; answering a questionnaire; participating in a
            study; entering contests or sweepstakes; or signing up to receive
            communications from us or another user.
          </p>
          <h2>10. Automatically-Collected Information</h2>
          <p>
            We automatically collect certain types of data when you use our
            services, regardless of whether you have an account. This data
            includes your IP address, technical information about your device
            (e.g., browser type, operating system, and basic device
            information), the web page you visited or search query you entered
            before reaching us, and your activities. We may track your
            activities using cookies and similar technologies. By using our
            services, you agree to our use of these methods as set forth in
            our&nbsp;cookie policy.

          <ul>
            <li>
              * <strong>Identification and authentication:</strong> we use your
              data to verify you when you access your account.
            </li>
            <li>
              * <strong>Communicating with you:</strong> we use your data when
              we communicate with you (e.g., when we respond to a customer
              support or other inquiry).
            </li>
            <li>
              * <strong>Improving our services:</strong> we use your data to
              understand how our services are being used and how we can improve
              them. In general, we analyze aggregated data, rather than specific
              user data. We may, however, need to analyze a specific case to
              address a specific problem (e.g., a bug that affects only a few
              accounts).
            </li>
            <li>
              * <strong>Customizing your experience:</strong> we use your data
              to personalize the service to you. This may include remembering
              your preferences for language or volume or displaying app that you
              might enjoy, based upon your viewing choices.
            </li>
            <li>
              * <strong>To ensure network and data security:</strong> We process
              your personal information in order to enhance security, monitor
              and verify identity or service access, combat spam or other
              malware or security risks and to comply with applicable security
              laws and regulations. The threat landscape on the internet is
              constantly evolving, which makes it more important than ever that
              we have accurate and up-to-date information about your use of
              Sentrei Services.
            </li>
            <li>

              data to respond to a subpoena or court order.
            </li>
            <li>
              * <strong>Protecting your information:</strong> where appropriate,
              we may anonymize, backup, and delete certain data.
            </li>
            <li>
              * <strong>For research and development:</strong> We process your
              personal information to better understand the way you use and

          <ul>
            <li>
              * Mobile advertising identifiers are identifiers used by mobile
              operating systems (Apple and/or Android) and made available to
              advertising providers to gather metrics on mobile apps (Apple’s
              IDFA or Google’s AAID) to help advertisers provide ads that may be
              more relevant to your interests.
            </li>

          <h2>31. California / Delaware Do Not Track Disclosures </h2>
          <p>
