# Weekly update [#1603](https://github.com/sentrei/sentrei/issues/1603)

## Quick reminder: what are you building, in a sentence?

"Where teams do their best work"

## What did you accomplish this week? Did you do everything you planned?

### We often find the best accomplishment summaries use bullet points to list out what you have done over the past week.

- Complete refurbishment of the landing page (https://github.com/sentrei/sentrei/issues/1609)
- Login & authentication & user management with Firebase (https://github.com/sentrei/sentrei/issues/1610)
- Core features implementation (https://github.com/sentrei/sentrei/issues/1611)

## What do you want to have done by the end of next week?

### Similar to above, bullet points often work best to describe your plans.

- Product launch!!!

## What would you like feedback on from the community?

### Optional.

- Landing Page! (Although the product itself is not finished yet)

## Project website
