# Weekly update [#1456](https://github.com/sentrei/sentrei/issues/1456)

## Quick reminder: what are you building, in a sentence?

SaaS Project (more to be revealed after launch...)

## What did you accomplish this week? Did you do everything you planned?

### We often find the best accomplishment summaries use bullet points to list out what you have done over the past week.

- Initial infrastructure & DevOps of the project (https://github.com/sentrei/sentrei/infrastructure)
- An initial sample landing page with Cloud Run & Firebase(https://sentrei.com)
- Configuration for fully-remote development with Codespace [since my mac is too slow]

## What do you want to have done by the end of next week?

### Similar to above, bullet points often work best to describe your plans.

- Complete refurbishment of the landing page (https://github.com/sentrei/sentrei/issues/1609)
- Login & authentication & user management with Firebase (https://github.com/sentrei/sentrei/issues/1610)
- Core features implementation (https://github.com/sentrei/sentrei/issues/1611)
