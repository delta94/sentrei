### Describe something weird or unusual that you've built or done early on in life. (Visible during the Tournament)

I was obsessed with the typography of a typical Word document. Early on, I would spend hours trying to perfect the alignment, font size, and tweak settings so that my personal Word document of a Japanese translation of Harry Potter would meet my standards just to please myself.

### Who is someone you personally know that will have an incredible impact on the world one day?

Everyone. There are too many uncontrollable factors in life for one individual to be credited with all of the incredible impacts.

Everyone. There are too many uncontrollable factors in life for one distinct individual to be credited with all of the positive impact towards the world.

### Describe a time when you intentionally broke the rules.

During a high school field trip to Kyoto, my friends and I decided to escape from the hotel at night to a nearby haunted temple as a means of testing our courage. Not satisfied and eager to go down in school history, we then decided to climb down the mountain to a national park.
